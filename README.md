# Automatic Light Fence Circuit Using Alarm

> **Micro Project for Linear Integrated Circuits (22ECC31)**
> Kongu Engineering College, Perundurai

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project implements a simple, low-cost intrusion detection system using a light fence principle. When a continuous light beam (from a laser or LED) is interrupted, the change is detected via an LDR, amplified with a transistor, and used to trigger a buzzer alarm. This system is an economical and effective way to secure passageways or entry points.

## 🛠️ Features

✅ Detects intrusions by breaking a light beam
✅ Immediate buzzer alarm response
✅ Low-cost, easy-to-build with common components
✅ Can be scaled with multiple beams
✅ Energy-efficient, works on a 9V battery

## 📝 Working Principle

1. A laser or LED continuously illuminates the LDR.
2. When an object interrupts the beam, the LDR resistance changes.
3. The voltage change is fed to a comparator or transistor-based amplifier.
4. The amplified signal switches a buzzer through a transistor switch.
5. The alarm sounds as long as the light beam is broken.
